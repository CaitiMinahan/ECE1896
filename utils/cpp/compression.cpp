//To read the compressed data onto the microcontroller's memory using C++, you need to develop code that can read the binary file and decompress it. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:
//
//Read the Binary File: Open the compressed binary file for reading in binary mode (std::ios::binary). Read the contents of the file into a buffer.
//
//Decompress the Data: Use zlib or another suitable decompression library to decompress the binary data. You'll need to allocate memory to store the decompressed data. Decompress the data from the buffer into this memory.
//
//Process the Decompressed Data: Once you have the decompressed data in memory, you can process it as needed. This may involve parsing the data, converting it back to its original format (e.g., CSV), and performing any necessary operations.
//
//Close File and Free Memory: Close the file after reading and release any dynamically allocated memory used for decompressed data.
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <zlib.h>
int main() {
    // Open the compressed binary file for reading
    std::ifstream file("compressed_data.bin", std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate);
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open file for reading." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Determine file size
    std::streamsize size = file.tellg();
    file.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);

    // Read the entire file into a buffer
    std::vector<char> buffer(size);
    if (!file.read(buffer.data(), size)) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to read from file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Close the file
    file.close();

    // Decompress the data
    std::vector<char> decompressed_buffer(size); // Assuming the decompressed size is the same as compressed size
    uLongf decompressed_size = decompressed_buffer.size();
    int result = uncompress((Bytef*)decompressed_buffer.data(), &decompressed_size, (const Bytef*)buffer.data(), size);
    if (result != Z_OK) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to decompress data. Error code: " << result << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Now you have the decompressed data in decompressed_buffer
    // Process the decompressed data as needed

    return 0;
